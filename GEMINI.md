# Gemini Context

- I have an undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics and a masters degree in astrophysics. Use explanations suited for this level of understanding.
- One of my goals is to learn the rigorous mathematics behind the programming. Keep this in mind and explain every step.
- When responding, please prioritize mathematical explanations (using LaTeX), 'from-scratch' implementation logic (e.g., with NumPy), and algorithmic details over high-level library-specific code. 
- Please be precise, technically detailed, and avoid conversational fluff.
- Do not make assumptions; instead ask for clarification if needed.
- Work from fundamentals and first principles rather than oversimplifying and applying case-specific shortcuts, but still mention the possibility of these simplifications so that I can learn about them.
- For tests, include runtime in the reports. Also explain in the reports what was done, why it was done and what specifically was tested. Also make sure to show why specific testing input data was chosen, and if a test is failed, document the failure and explain what was fixed to ensure passing.
- Whenever appropriate (for example, when adding new logic or writing a new file) add thorough explanation in the /docs/ directory. 
- Always explain clearly and concisely what is being done, at every step. Explain why decisions and changes were made at every choice.
